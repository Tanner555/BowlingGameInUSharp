-- InputBinding
Cannot Bind Input From C#. Can use wrapper ufunctions and bind from blueprints.

-- FMulticastDelegate
Cannot Broadcast an instance of a FMulticastDelegate. There isn't any Broadcast method inside the Delegate Classes inside the Runtime Solution.

-- Static Value Garbage Collection
Static Values Do Not Become Null When the game ends. This causes issues when accessing a nullptr when the game restarts, causing the engine to crash.
I simply use a static variable of WorldStaticVar, which handles deleting the value after the world is unloaded.

-- Async Methods
Running an Async Method By Default Will Cause the Function to run on a separate thread. 
Using FThreading.RunOnGameThread may help fix the issues this may cause.

--Coroutines
Using a Coroutines currently causes the engine to crash. I have no idea what's causing this issue.
