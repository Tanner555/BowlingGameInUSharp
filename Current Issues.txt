-- InputBinding
Cannot Bind Input From C#. Can use wrapper ufunctions and bind from blueprints.

-- FMulticastDelegate
Cannot Broadcast an instance of a FMulticastDelegate. There isn't any Broadcast method inside the Delegate Classes inside the Runtime Solution.

-- Static Value Garbage Collection
Static Values Do Not Become Null When the game ends. This causes issues when accessing a nullptr when the game restarts, causing the engine to crash.
I simply set the static value to null in ReceiveEndPlay.
