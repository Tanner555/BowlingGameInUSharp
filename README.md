# BowlingGameInUSharp
I've updated USharp Bowling To Run Primarily On C++/Blueprints For Improved Flexibility and
Compatibility With Upcoming Versions of Unreal Engine. The older version of USharpBowling was
archived in the CSharp4-24Version branch, which is only compatible with UE 4.24 and has several bugs
that haven't been fixed.

You can also find the old C# scripts inside the Managed/OLDREFUSharpBowlProject folder. I'll likely reimplement
certain c# features in the future.

If you download this project, make sure to update the UProject file to remove whatever plugins you do not have.
For instance, I have RiderSourceCodeAccess plugin installed from the Marketplace by default. 

I'll likely not update the itch.io build of USharp Bowling with the new C++ version. It kind of defeats the purpose
of showing off the potential of c# scripting. Keep in mind the itch.io version uses a previous version of 
USharp bowling that runs on an older version than UE 4.24.

Feel free to check out USharp if you want to try writing c# scripts for UE4: https://github.com/pixeltris/USharp

You can play the game on itch.io.
